# About
I made this while following along a [Laravel tutorial](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch).

This was the first big project I made while coding along. It was complicated because it took for granted many programming concepts and conventions. But it helped me learn about various conventions and some basic principles and standards different websites, made using any different software, abide by.

I gathered a basic understanding of databases function and store information, the different kinds that exist, the commanlities and differences between them. I learnt enough to be able to dive into learning any kind of system, SQL or NoSQL, and be able to understand the concepts really quickly.

Making this project also helped me understand and learn basic CSS and HTML development. How I can structure code, how to link different files, and how to use templating engines like Blade. Because of this, grasping the working of different templates like EJS and Django-HTML has been very easy as they all work on similar concepts.

This was my first introduction to working with a web-development framework. It was instrumental in teaching me how they generally work, enough that I have a solid footing in any if I choose to learn that particular framework.
